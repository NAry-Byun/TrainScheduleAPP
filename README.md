Our initial goal was to complete the train schedule mobile application within three months, spanning from December 2023 to February 2024, coinciding with the summer vacation.

As we had not delved into backend development yet, our starting point involved gaining insights into accessing the PTV API and understanding database operations. However, this process proved more time-consuming than anticipated, raising concerns about project completion. Seeking guidance from our mentors, we decided to revise the plan, opting for a more concise approach while ensuring clarity in project objectives.
